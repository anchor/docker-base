docker-base
============

Base build scripts for docker images


# Create a new docker build from this repo


Let's call your repo `docker-myproject`


Your repo should have the following structure
     | build
     | src
       - baseline
       - dependencies
       - release

`src/` - copy the examples from the `docker-base/samples` directory to your `docker-myproject/src` folder

`build` - copy the example file from `docker-base/samples/build`
